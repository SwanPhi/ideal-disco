Hello world,
I am here to learn and practise Python in Data Science.  Previously I was a web developer in ASP/JSP, Javascript, CSS, HTML years ago before raising a family in London, UK.  I have work as part time web developer in Hong Kong for more than 2 years.  
Now I would like to persue a career in Data Science as I see the power of big data and what we learn from it.
